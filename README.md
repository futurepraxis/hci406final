# hci406final

HCI 406 Final was completed as, you guessed it, my final project for HCI 406: Web Design at DePaul University. 

For this project, we were asked to complete a small site for a small business. The site had several requirements, including being responsive on web, tablet, and mobile, and including a responsive CSS flexbox image grid. I chose to make the site for a local artist, Mack Oliver, who teaches children's yoga and dance in Chicago. From a visual perspective, the challenge became creating a site that was just as vibrant, fun, colorful, and engaging with kids as Mack is. I therefore chose to create a site that was as large, colorful, and playful as Mack herself.
